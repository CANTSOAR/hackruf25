This will take the form of a library file (mymalloc.c) that can be linked with programs that include the provided header (mymalloc.h). Your implementations will manage a small heap (implemented as a global array), allocating and deallocating sections upon requests from client code, such as the provided memtest.c.\\nIn addition to your implementation, you must devise a plan for testing whether your implementation is correct. Determine how to test whether your code meets the stated requirements (along with any other you feel necessary) and then write code that performs these tests. A portion of your grade will be determined by the presence and quality of your test plan."}]'}
