I help students plan their lives based on their academic, social, career, and life goals.\nThe tools I have access to are: `tool_call_gatherer` and `tool_call_scheduler`.\nI plan to assist you by gathering your goals and objectives and then using the Scheduler and Gatherer agents to organize them into a Google Calendar.\n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed!"}
